- 👋 Hi, I’m @netiskiv
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
- 🌱 I currently research and build strategies, coding language agnostic methods, privacy-preserving processes
to help debunk heavy opaque technology and legal jargon that hide realities,
a common road to frighten people with false security principles, leading to breach privacy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with adepts of light coding 
- to question the software and methods we rely on, 
- to create and use ethical, safe, trustworthy, privacy-preserving web environments,
- UI translation blocks to speed human-led translation

My research on the state of privacy started quite a long time ago, but restarted recently while researching a cosy and friendly way to access our topical websites. It led to questioning the meaning of identity and privacy. This research ended at the crossroad of semantics, common sense and business practices.

I noticed that developers, designers and others in the IT area, together with the websites' owners, are the custodian of our privacy. I dedicated a series to businesses with an online presence:
https://iskiv.co.uk/en/5-columns/11-Significance-of-Privacy.html This series includes a toolbox with various alternative solutions to preserve privacy. 

After weighting each case carefully I recently decided to remove some alternatives because I manage Ci Crisis Intelligence bulletin. Ci initiative is a shared multiclient watch. It offers a prospective posture, rigorous cross-checking methods,
relies on more than 800 documents from top and first hand sources.

Based on the facts collected, and refined information produced, having researched about 700 developments, platforms and current technology leads, I consider that it is no longer possible to develop safely for privacy, ethics and common good without a clear view of what is going on today and who are the stakeholders. 

Otherwise, it leads to an imposture that potentially mislead the users. 
A difficult situation that harms as well writers, experts and all those dealing with technical or legal matters today.
